db.imdb.aggregate([
    {$match: {
        countries: {$in: ["Italy"]},
        directors: {$exists: true}
    }},
    {$group: {
        _id: null,
        avg_num_directors: {$avg: {
            $size: "$directors"

    b. contain a number for IMDB score ratings (you can check it by using $type)

    - the average published year, and
    - the maximum score on IMDB

db.imdb.aggregate([
    {$match: {
        "imdb.rating": {$exists: true, $type: "number"}
    }},
    {$unwind: "$genres"},
    {$group: {
        _id: "$genres",
        avg_published_year: {$avg: "$year"},
        max_score_IMDB: {$max: "$imdb.rating"}
    }}
])

        number_of_movies: {$sum: 1}
    }},
    {$sort: {
        number_of_movies: -1
    }}
